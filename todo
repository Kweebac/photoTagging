# Main todo

1. Choose large image with characters to find (Waldo, The Wizard, Wilma etc.) and save pixel positions of each character to your database
2. On click place box around area and give list of character options to choose from
3. On character select check if your box matches the pixel position in your backend and say if wrong or correct
4. If correct place a marker on the character
5. Remove targeting box
6. Keep track of how long it takes from when the photo is first loaded to when the user finds all characters (do on server side)
7. When finished, ask for their ign, save ign & time in database (no login system)
